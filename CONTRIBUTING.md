# Contributing to the NHSBSA design System

This design system is for everyone. It was built as a way to suppliment the [NHS.UK Design System](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system) with things we've found work for us as an organisation. Any patterns or components we find have a wider use will be shared with NHS Digital, and hopefully resused by dleivery teams across the NHS. The more we contribute, the more it becomes easier to maintain a visual language across both public and staff facing services.

## How to contribute

Anyone can propose, develop or contribute to new patterns and components, or improvements to existing ones. 

The NHSBSA Design System has an open [backlog](https://github.com/nhsbsa/design-system/projects/1). 

Follow 3 steps to propose an idea or suggestion.

### 1. Share the work
Talk about the pattern or component to the community. Share your work, as other teams might be working on the same thing. Gather feedback and examples from the community. We currently have a [confluence wiki](https://bsa2468.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DES/pages/1597407233/Digital+patterns) showing the things we know about different common patterns or components. We're slowly moving all to open source so we can share our learning.

### 2. Check the backlog
Check if the pattern or component is already on the backlog. If it is, please comment and post screenshots of your example. 

### 3. Raise a new issue
If your idea is not on the backlog, raise an issue. We'll discuss your proposal in the joint Service Design community of practice.

When raising an issue, explain why you think it should be included in the design system. You can also include screenshots and research notes. Please raise feature requests as issues before contributing any code.

This ensures they are discussed properly before any time is spent on them.


## Raising bugs

When raising bugs please explain the issue in good detail and provide a guide to how to replicate it.
