# NHS Business Services Authority Design System

The system contains patterns, components and styles to improve consistency across services and reduce duplication of work.

It's purpose is to extend the [NHS.UK Service Manual](https://beta.nhs.uk/service-manual/) with work specific to the NHSBSA. 

This helps us align to Point 13 of the NHS Service Standard - [**Use and contribute to open standards, common components and patterns**](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/service-standard). 

## Contributing

You can contribute by discussing and proposing components and patterns.

Read our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/nhsbsa/design-system/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and then check the [community backlog](https://github.com/nhsbsa/design-system/projects/1) to see what's needed.

## Credit
- This system has been built using the NHS Digital Service Manual https://beta.nhs.uk/service-manual/.
- We've adapted some of our patterns from the [Home Office Design System](https://design.homeoffice.gov.uk/), as we found similarities between NHS and HO casework processes.
- Our principles are adapted from the GOV.UK Design System principles and may evolve over time to better reflect the NHSBSA digital teams.

# Community Principles

These principles are for the community of people that create and contribute to these components and patterns. 

## 1. Start with what exists

Reuse as much as possible and iterate based on user needs. 

There's lots of places to look, check what exists in:

- [NHS.UK Design System](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system)
- [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/)

If something is not in the published design systems, check the community backlogs and other department design systems to see what colleagues in other departments have done before.

### Central design system backlogs
- [NHS.UK Design System backlog](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual-backlog/projects/1)
- [GOV.UK Design System backlog](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/projects/1)

### Other Government department design systems
- [Home Office](https://design.homeoffice.gov.uk/)
- [HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC)](https://design.tax.service.gov.uk/)
- [Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA)](https://dvsa-front-end.herokuapp.com/)
- [HM Land Registry](hmlr-design-system.herokuapp.com)
- [Department of Work and Pensions (DWP)](https://dwp-design-examples.herokuapp.com/)
- [Ministry of Justice (MOJ)](https://moj-design-system.herokuapp.com/)
- [HM Courts and Tribunals Service](https://hmcts-design-system.herokuapp.com/)
- [Office of National Statistics (ONS)](https://ons-design-system.netlify.app/)

Reach out to the community to ask questions, gather examples and learn from othersâ€™ mistakes.

## 2. Contribute back and help others

This design system is for everyone at the NHSBSA. Anyone can contribute evidenced-based changes. 

Think beyond your service and aim to design components and patterns that are scalable, reusable and can evolve over time.


Share research findings and examples with others. Be open to feedback or changes to your work.

Above all, **be kind**. Encourage others to contribute by being respectful when asking questions or giving feedback.
## 3. Prioritise openness and honesty

[NHS design principle number 9](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system/design-principles) - **Make things open. It makes things better**  

Sharing your designs helps others to solve similar problems by reducing duplication of effort and time spent, which means our patients and NHS colleagues get services that we know work.

Share work in progress as early as possible. Be honest about the amount and nature of your research and findings. Share what works and what does not.
