      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">When to use this component</h2>
      <p>Use alerts to inform users that something important has happened. Either an action they need to take or to notify them of a success/failure.</p>

      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">When not to use this component</h2>
      <p>Only use when you have identified that users need alerting to certain content.</p>

      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">User research</h2>
      <p>Passport renewals found this component worked better then the confirmation pattern for a payment success page. They observed users engaged with the next steps on the page, rather than thinking they were finished.</p>

      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Services using this pattern</h2>
      <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Passport renewals</li>
