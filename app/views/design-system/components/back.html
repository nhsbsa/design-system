      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">When to use this component</h2>
      <p>Always include a back link on question pages.</p>

      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">When not to use this component</h2>
      <p>Don’t use the back link component together with breadcrumbs. On non-linear flows a back link could confuse users. Do research to see what works for your service.</p>

      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">How to use</h2>
      <p>Adding a page title or ‘back to previous page’ makes it clearer to the user what to expect from the interaction. It also helps increase a users confidence that they will not lose their work.</p>
      <p>Back links should always be at the top of a page. Make sure the link takes users to the previous page and that it works without JavaScript.</p>

      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">User research</h2>
      <p>We have seen some users not understand the context of the current back link design. This has caused them anxiety.</p>
      <p>Some users have been concerned that using the back link would lose their work.</p>
