        <p class="nhsuk-body-l">Components are ready-made interface elements that can be used in  different patterns and layouts. They are part of our visual language and are intended to be used unchanged for a consistent user experience.</p>
        
        <p>These components extend those used in the <a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system/components">NHS Digital service manual</a>. As our components mature, we will look to contribute them to the NHS Digital service manual so they can be used more widely.</p>
