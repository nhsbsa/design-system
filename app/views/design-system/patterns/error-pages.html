      <h1 class="heading-section">Error pages</h1>
      <p class="nhsuk-body-l">Inform a user when something goes wrong.</p>

      <p>When a user visits a web page, the server responds with a HTTP status code. In most cases the user journey isn't affected - unless there is an error. Error statuses are sorted into two groups - 400 to 499 are client-side errors and 500 to 599 are server-side errors.</p>

      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Error pages should:</h2>
      <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
        <li>be avoided - do the hard work to make sure they don't happen</li>
        <li>use plain English and avoid technical jargon</li>
        <li>avoid listing the error code - a user shouldn't need to know the error code</li>
        <li>make it clear how to get help</li>
        <li>if possible tell the user if they can complete the transaction on another channel</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">404 page</h2>
      <p>404 errors (sometimes known as 'page not found errors') tell a user the page they were trying to access is not there. Users encounter 404 errors when:</p>
      <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
        <li>we make a mistake - for example a user follows a link that is broken</li>
        <li>the user makes a mistake - inputting a link incorrectly</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3 class="nhsuk-u-visually-hidden">404 error page example</h3>

      <div class="example example-images confirmation details-margin-btm">
        <img src="/images/404-page.svg" class="confirm-desktop" alt="Two example 404 pages, one for user error and one for a service error. With a title 'this page cannot be found' and guidance on what the user should do next.">

      </div>

      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">500 page</h2>
      <p>500 errors happen when something goes wrong on the server-side. Common causes are when the server is down or maintenance work is happening.</p>

      <p>You do not need to show different error pages for different server problems. 500 pages should only be used for short periods of time. If there is going to be a disruption to users for an extended period use shutter pages like these <a href="http://hmrc-design-language-prototype.herokuapp.com/design-patterns/patterns/pages/shutter_pages/">HMRC examples</a>.</p>
