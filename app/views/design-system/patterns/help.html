      <p class="nhsuk-body-l">Small overlays containing help content for complex interactions.</p>

      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">When to use help</h2>
      <p>Only use help to explain things like business processes. It shouldn't be relied upon to solve design problems - services should always be simple and intuitive (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/create-a-service-thats-simple">service stand point 12</a>). Contextual help is more suited to complex internal services. </p>

      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">How to use help</h2>
      <p>Help should be easy to close, move and minimise until the user needs it.</p>
      <p>If contextual help doesn&rsquo;t answer a user&rsquo;s question, links to more comprehensive help should be easy to find.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/help-text">GDS has guidance for help content</a>.

      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">User research</h2>
      <p>Users find side-by-side guidance more helpful and easier to use.</p>
      <p>Small overlay windows offer the smallest interference with the users flow.</p>
      <p>This is a <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/pop-up-adaptive-help/">good article on contextual help</a> from Nielsen Norman.</p>
