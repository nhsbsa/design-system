      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">When to use this pattern</h2>
      <p>Modals should be avoided in most cases. They are hard to make accessible and do not work well in mobile views.</p>
      <p>Adding content to a new page instead of showing it in a modal should be the default approach.</p>
      <p>Modals however can be useful when you need to draw a users attention to something, for example timeout warnings.</p>

      <h2 id="interaction" class="nhsuk-heading-m">How modals work</h2>
      <p>A modal should focus on a single task.</p>
      <p>If the modal is user triggered, the content that opens the modal window (for example, a link or button) should explain to the user what will happen.</p>
      <p>Modals should include a heading.</p>
      <p>Extra attention should be made to make sure modals are accessible.</p>
